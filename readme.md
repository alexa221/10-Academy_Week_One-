## Introduction

This project aims to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on telecom data to identify patterns and trends that can provide valuable insights. The primary goal is to understand user behavior on various applications and derive recommendations for potential growth opportunities..

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this analysis pertains to user activities on a telecom network. It includes information such as the number of xDR sessions, session duration, total download (DL) and upload (UL) data, and total data volume for each application. Additional details about the source, format, and key features of the dataset will be provided in the analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the analysis code, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

Python (version 3.12)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Streamlit
psycopg2
sqlalchemy 
### Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

-Clone this repository to your local machine.

-Install the required dependencies using the command: 
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning

andling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality is crucial. 
The cleaning process will be described in detail in the analysis.

### Visualizations

Representative visualizations, including histograms, box plots, 
and correlation matrices, will be provided to enhance understanding.

### Key Findings

Summarize the key insights obtained from the EDA, focusing on trends, patterns, and relationships within the telecom data.

## Next Steps

After the EDA, potential next steps will be outlined, which may include feature engineering, modeling, or further analysis.

## Acknowledgments

Acknowledge any libraries, resources, or datasets that were used in the analysis.
